\title{Compute a matrix of counts from a list of x,y positions}
\description{
 Compute a matrix in which the counts in each cell represent the number of 
 occurrences of that cell's coordinates in a list of x,y cooordinate values,
 optionally computing a second matrix of the average of the values attached
 to the coordinate observations.
}
\usage{
 makeDensityMatrix(x,y,z=NULL,nx=100,ny=50,zfun=c("mean","sum"),
 xlim=c(-180,180),ylim=c(-90,90),geocoord=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
 \item{x,y}{Vectors of x and y coordinates. These are usually combined in a
  matrix or data frame of two columns.}
 \item{z}{Optional values attached to each coordinate pair. If these are present,
  it can be in a matrix or data frame of three columns, x, y and z.}
 \item{nx}{The number of "x" cells in the output matrix.}
 \item{ny}{The number of "y" cells in the output matrix.}
 \item{zfun}{The function to apply to the summed values attached to each 
  coordinate pair. Currently defaults to mean, otherwise the sum is returned.}
 \item{xlim}{The extreme coordinates in the horizontal direction (see Details).}
 \item{ylim}{The extreme coordinates in the vertical direction (see Details).}
 \item{geocoord}{Whether to correct the matrix values for the areal distortion
  of the Mercator projection.}
}
\details{
 \samp{makeDensityMatrix} expects two vectors or a matrix or data frame with 
 at least two columns. The function was written for geographic coordinates,
 but will also work for other numeric coordinates. An optional third vector 
 or column of values for each coordinate will be processed.
 
 Each coordinate pair adds to the count in that cell of the matrix. If there
 is a third element, that value is added to a second matrix in the same 
 position. By default, the function computes the mean of all values in each 
 cell. If \samp{zfun="sum"}, the sum of values in each cell will be returned.
 
 As geograhic data sets may be very large, leading to memory problems, 
 \samp{makeDensityMatrix} can be run on small sections of the data set and the
 resulting matrices added together as long as the coordinate limits are
 consistent throughout.
}
\value{
 Either a matrix of counts of coordinate pairs within each cell or a list of
 two such matrices, the second containing the mean or sum of values associated 
 with coordinate pairs.
